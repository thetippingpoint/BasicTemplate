We are committed to the election of a progressive Democrat to represent the citizens of New Jersey's 2nd congressional district. Currently Republican Frank LoBiondo is the districts congressman. We are groups and constituents concerned about the policies of the Trump administration and determined to rebuild and energize the democratic party around policies to help this district.  We support a living wage, the right of worker's to unionize, tough environmental standards, access to good public education, healthcare for all, women's rights, protection of civil rights for all minorities, and campaign finance reform.
